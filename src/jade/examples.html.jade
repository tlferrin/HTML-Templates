								p.bold Introduction
								p The question that I’m addressing is something about my journey as an LDS scholar. And the interesting thing about that term ‘LDS scholar’ is that is suggests there’s something unique about being an LDS scholar as opposed to some other. And there is. I think, as I would characterize that term, I see a combination of spirit and reason that make what we might call an ‘LDS scholar.'
								p.bold Growing up Jewish but not religious
								p First of all, I didn’t know that such a thing could exist, earlier in my life. But it’s interesting that it was reason that introduced me to spirit. I grew up without any religion in my life at all—formally. My grandparents were all Russian Jews who immigrated here early twentieth century to avoid the pogroms—to escape the pogroms. They were very Fiddler on the Roof people—and they were—but there was no religion practiced in my home. We were a long way from any other Jewish community, so I grew up without ever going to formal church meetings, synagogue meetings, training, or any of that sort of thing. One set of grandparents whom I saw infrequently but maybe once or twice a year were closer to orthodox, and so I was exposed to Passover meal every year—things like that. But it really wasn’t part of me.
								p.bold Reason leading toward spirit at Berkeley
								p As I attended my undergraduate university training in the sciences at the University of California–Berkeley (in the sixties, by the way), the things that I was learning about our universe, our physical world, and its genius, actually inspired me. And, in spite of the prevailing ideology of the day—which was that given enough time, anything will happen by chance—I just couldn’t accept that, and it seemed there was a genius behind our world, our universe. And I awakened to that as a beginning and said, ‘There’s something there.’ It was not a formal awakening, but it was reason leading me towards spirit. So that beginning.
								p.bold Discovering the New Testament at Wisconsin–Madison
								p And graduate school—I met my wife, who was born and raised as a very devout Protestant. And she was—if they used the term ‘active’ as we use it, she was very active. She attended church every Sunday. Actually, most churches don’t require much more than that, but she did that and had gone to a parochial high school, and had paraphrased the entire Bible from Genesis 1 to Revelation. And was serious about it, and that was a surprise to me. So, I eventually ended up, as our relationship went further, taking lessons from her pastor there at the university in Madison, Wisconsin, and ended up also reading the New Testament for the first time. But, the things I learned were not connecting [in the mind]. Without the Restoration, there are huge holes in Christian doctrine. And I met wonderful people—they were wonderful people—they were very faithful people. But who, in my judgment, had to compartmentalize their life. Reason dictated most of their life. Spirit was something they alluded to and immersed themselves in for short periods of time every week, but they didn’t know how to bring them together because of the huge lapses in doctrinal issues that didn’t make sense. And so, spirit and reason seemed to be chasms apart. And yet, I had an experience with the New Testament that suggested by spirit that something happened 2,000 years ago.
								p.bold Meeting Mormon missionaries
								p And so, there we were when the LDS missionaries knocked on our door, started to teach us—with great reluctance from my wife, by the way (and she admits that). But, one of the early discussions, which I don’t even remember, ended with the missionaries asking if I had any questions. Well, my experience with some of these big questions that I didn’t see answers to when I was being taught by my wife’s pastor was that in many cases he didn’t understand the question—in the sense that it didn’t need to make sense, so why was there a problem? And so, with these LDS missionaries asking, ‘Well, do you have any questions,’ I decided to see if this was going to be a fruitful relationship at all—and let’s start with one of those. And as I began to ask one of those major questions, one of those missionaries finished the question for me. And I was surprised, and I said, ‘Yeah, do you have an answer?’ He had told us earlier there were going to be seven discussions, and he said, ‘Yeah, but that’s not till the fifth discussion.’ And I almost threw him out the third-floor window.
								p That was the beginning of my sensing that these missionaries were more tuned-in to reason and spirit combined—that they were going to be able to answer questions, and they in fact eventually did. Would there be spirit? Would it only be reason? Well, we learned something about that as well. The two missionaries that ended up teaching us the most were a split between a stake missionary—a local family man in his late thirties, I would judge—and a full-time twenty-year-old missionary from Provo, Utah. And the stake missionary was an interesting, fairly intense brother, who was very knowledgeable and tried to—and successfully tried to—be very spiritual.
								p.bold Combining faith and reason
								p So, one of the early discussions that we had was not actually among the lessons that they formally had from the mission president’s office, but was something he’d learned from his mission president, who was Alvin R. Dyer. It basically was based on Alma 32, and the missionaries explained what Alma was trying to teach about faith and reason and knowledge. As they did, of course they tried to explain what Alma was trying to describe when he described feeling spiritual responses. Of course, for those of us who had not had that kind of experience—at least identified—it was hard for me to separate that from—in fact, what I told them was, ‘It sounds like you’re trying to talk yourself into something.’ And they said, ‘No, it’s different.’
								p We went back and forth—we didn’t know they had a curfew. This discussion I think ended about one in the morning. Finally, the stake missionary (they’d realized we’d reached a point of no progress, and they decided it was time to leave)—and finally the stake missionary, who was very intense in the way that he also made his points (he’d always point his finger when there was something he really wanted me to pay attention to—us to pay attention to—my wife and I both). He said, ‘Okay, I can’t explain it to you, but the things that we tell you are going to seem strangely familiar, and you’re going to know that they’re true—you’re going to know it.’ And we said, ‘Yeah, yeah. Okay.’
								p The other part of that discussion I think I should mention was that, as part of Alma’s description of the Lord answering prayer, I had a response to that in my mind, which was ‘reason and spirit,’ because I had already experienced the fact that there were many religions in the world and doctrines and proponents and antagonists. And, especially if you don’t believe that your observations are going to be able to sort all of that out, I thought, ‘It makes sense that if there is a God’—and that’s the stage I was at at the time, formally—’If there is a god, and he really wants me to know something’—like he’s restored his church, like the missionaries were trying to tell us—’he would know that we couldn’t figure that out on our own, and that the only way we would know would be if he told us.’ That made sense. Kind of a combination of reason and spirit together. But the other reaction I had was, in my worldly point of view, it was preposterous to think that God would actually talk to man. I mean, they put people in jail or in asylums who say that. I didn’t think that was possible. But, nevertheless, we had that discussion, and it ended that night with that stake missionary making that promise.
								p.bold Conducting Alma’s experiment
								p Then, as part of that, as we progressed through that, I and my wife both were given assignments by the missionaries—missionaries know how to do that: ‘Would you read these verses of scripture before we come next time?’ We were students—I was a graduate student and my wife was finishing her undergraduate program, and we would politely agree, at least in the moment, that we would try to do that.
								p The other thing they would ask us to do was to pray about it, and they’d taught us how to go through the steps of prayer. We reluctantly but positively did say yes we would do that. Especially since, I had this experience where I said, ‘You know, that makes sense, so if I’m going to conduct this experiment, I can’t say I know there would be answers—the results of the experiment—unless I conduct it.’ Reason and spirit. And so, we went on through these discussions, and the missionaries would ask each time, ‘Did you read the things we asked you to read? Did you pray about the things we asked you to pray about?’ The answer was usually no, we hadn’t done that. So I started feeling guilty.
								p One Saturday morning, I think, I felt sufficiently guilty to say, ‘All right, I promised I would read; I promised I would pray.’ I sat down and I began reading the Book of Mormon. Nephi, Chapter 1, verse 1: ‘I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents’ and on and on. And read for probably an hour and a half. I remember my wife as she’d been going about her various activities, walked by at one particular moment in our little third-floor apartment living room where I was sitting. I looked up at her from where I was sitting, and I said, ‘I don’t know what else is true, but that young man didn’t make up this book.’ But I didn’t think that much about that.
								p The other thing that happened during that time was that I did pray for the first time in my life. I waited till my wife wasn’t home—this was a very embarrassing and intimidating kind of experience—in fact so much so that we had two cats, and I even locked them out of the room. But I did offer a prayer, and it was probably one of the most sincere prayers I’ve ever offered. It was, basically, ‘Father in heaven,’—because that was what we were being taught to say—“’if you’re there and this is your church, I will do what you ask me to do.’ Nothing happened. Moroni didn’t appear in my bedroom. No light appeared. But I did have that experience while reading. But didn’t think that much more about it. And so the discussions came and went—until the night of the fifth discussion.
								p.bold Plan of Salvation
								p The fifth discussion was about the Plan of Salvation. In those days the missionaries used flannel boards and paper pictures. Which I learned later they’d borrowed from a primary teacher who developed this system in Orem, Utah, in the ward I lived in—and I later called her to be my Relief Society president. (But, getting way ahead of myself.) The diagram that the missionaries developed as they told us about the Plan of Salvation was with a premortal world, and a veil of forgetfulness, and an earth, and a spirit world, and then three degrees of glory.
								p As my wife and I listened and watched and observed and participated to whatever degree—we read verses we were asked to read and so forth—during that whole time that evening, we both knew—knew—that what they were telling us was true, not like we were hearing it for the first time but that we were helping them practice. We didn’t say anything to each other. We didn’t say anything to them to indicate that; although, apparently the way we responded was enough of an indication that we learned later from the missionaries that after they walked out of our apartment door, they turned to each other and shook hands and floated to their car.
								p.bold What’s the Catch?
								p But they didn’t challenge us to baptism that night. I believe that we would not have been ready. They came back and taught us the sixth discussion and then came back and taught us the seventh discussion. And then came back on a hot day for some lemonade and came back for another day to show us a filmstrip and came back to stand in front of our air conditioner and came back for every excuse they could think of to come back—and still didn’t challenge us to baptism.
								p One night, after this had been going on for a while, I said to my wife, ‘What are we going to do about these crazy Mormons? Because if this thing is true, it’s the biggest thing in the last 2,000 years. Why isn’t it on the six o’ clock news? Why isn’t it on the headlines of every major newspaper?’ When that’s not the case, there’s usually a catch. There’s got to be a catch. Well, I wonder who we could ask about whether there’s a catch. Well, we’ve got this Protestant minister that we knew, and in fact, he helped perform our wedding. (By that time, we’d been married for over a year.) And so, we’ll call this minister and ask him if there’s anything he knows that’s wrong with the Mormons.
								p.bold Faith resonating in the mind and in the heart
								p Well, most Latter-day Saints are pretty aware of what kind of response I might have elicited. And fortunately the Lord was aware as well, because I picked up the phone, and I dialed the number. I got a teenage son on the phone who said his father was not home; no he didn’t know when he’d be back, but it was nine thirty at night or so, and clearly he wasn’t going to be out much later, and so I’d just call back. I hung up the phone. Before I even took my hand off the phone, our doorbell rang. Went down and answered the door—our front door was a stairway down—answered the door and there stood two missionaries.
								p They came in and sat down. We sat down. It was the night before my wife’s final exam, so she was still paging through her biochemistry notes. And they were asking such relevant questions as ‘How are you?’ [We said,] ‘We’re fine. How are you?’ Finally I said, ‘What can I do for you?’ The stake missionary raised his finger and said, ‘We don’t know why we’re here—you tell us.’ And the Spirit bore witness to me that this was not a forgery—this was not a dramatic play—that if this had been a test, they would have failed it—that is, if it had been an artificial test. But that this was who they were and that the Lord had sent them. So I told them why—and I knew at that moment. I knew why. I said, ‘I just made a phone call. That’s why you’re here.’ Then they proceeded to explain to both my wife and I what had happened the night of the fifth discussion—that we had received an answer to prayer. And that was the beginning of our journey as LDS scholars, and we did accept their challenge to baptism that night.
								p So that was the beginning of knowing, okay, reason—understanding the Plan of Salvation resonates both [in the mind] and [in the heart]. A God with a purpose resonates both [in the mind] and [in the heart]. So that was the beginning.
								p.bold Praying about professor positions
								p The next chapter, I guess, in becoming LDS scholars was coming to BYU, because of all places on the earth, this is the perfect place to combine reason and spirit. I didn’t know that—I didn’t know that even after we joined the Church. We were sealed in one of the Provo temples the year after we joined the Church and did walk on the BYU campus, guided by that full-time missionary from Provo, Utah, who’d returned home. But hadn’t thought much about it since.
								p Now, three years after that, we were finishing a postdoctoral position and wondering what we should do next, and BYU is not in my mind at all. Yet, for various reasons, knelt one early morning and asked the Lord where he wanted me to go—because my conversion was at the point that I wanted to be where He wanted me to be.
								p And, one of those defining moments—I don’t pretend that this happens often—but one of those defining moments: I very distinctly heard or felt the voice of the Lord say, ‘BYU,’ and I was both shocked because I hadn’t considered it and contemplative about the possibility. And struggled with it because we loved doing missionary work by that time and had some positive experiences doing missionary work. Had friends join the Church or become reactivated because—well, not because but certainly in association with our getting to know them and sharing our testimonies with them and encouraging them.
								p So, coming to Utah and working at BYU wasn’t what was on our mind at first. But, as I prayed about it more and thought about it more, the possibilities began to develop in my mind where I began to understand why the Lord might want me to come here. And, not knowing exactly what the climate was like here—but knowing how I might feel working for the Lord rather than for any other employer sounded like a great idea. The only problem was I knew that now, and the Lord knew that, but BYU didn’t know that.
								p.bold Calling the BYU Department of Chemical Engineering
								p I picked up the phone in the middle of the summer of 1976, called down to the university, had learned they had a chemical engineering department, so I asked for that department. Secretary answered the phone (a young lady that I still remember), and I asked her what the name of the department chair was. And she told me, and I said, ‘By any chance, could he talk to me on the phone?’ And she said, ‘Yes, just a minute.’
								p About thirty seconds later, a voice came on the phone, and I explained to him who I was and that I was looking for a job. And he began to ask me questions about where I’d gone to college, both undergraduate and graduate school, and who I’d worked for in my graduate work, and what my research interests were, and all these different questions. And while I was answering all of those, I’m thinking to myself, ‘He’s got to think I’m some sort of crazy person, because you don’t apply for a job this way.’ But when we finished the question–answer part of the discussion, he paused for a moment, and he said, ‘It’s really funny that you should call right now. We just made a decision that we wanted to hire somebody in your research area.’ And, three months later I was here. And that’s fast for BYU.
								p.bold First BYU university conference
								p So, that was the beginning, again, of spirit and reason coming together here. But, I think I began to understand that opportunity first when I attended my very first university conference that fall of 1976. I had been at two major universities for my own education and in a postdoctoral situation. And in none of them was there really a preponderance of spirit in classroom or otherwise. In fact, in the postdoctoral position I’d been in, there had been some rather uncomfortable and undesirable kinds of elements in the relationships with some manipulation and backbiting and those kinds of things.
								p And so coming from that postdoctoral experience and now walking into the Marriott Center with 2-3,000 people, all employees of the university—faculty, staff, administrators—and we began with an LDS hymn and a prayer, and it felt very different and very good. And I began to sense that this is the place where we do the work of the university, but we do it in the context and under the banner and under the influence of the spirit. Of course, I learned more later about Karl G. Maeser, and Brigham Young saying to Brother Maeser, ‘Don’t even teach the multiplication tables without the Spirit.’ So, that was my introduction to spirit and reason coming together at BYU, and the beginning of that chapter of my LDS scholar journey.
								p.bold Spirit and reason as a researcher
								p So, how does that play—how did it play for me? It played in a couple of arenas here. One had to do with my research activities and my research interactions, not only with students, but with colleagues, and just the struggles of doing experimental work, and publishing papers, getting grants. And, of course, one element of that, which I don’t believe is totally unique to BYU, but good people everywhere I think are benefitted by the light of Christ. I think our Father in Heaven illuminates our efforts if we’re doing things that furthers his purposes, even if we don’t know we are. And, I can say that there were times when I felt that I was being aided in my work, and I was grateful for that. That certainly is one component of being an LDS scholar.
								p.bold Spirit and reason as a colleague
								p But one that I thought was maybe even more interesting was—like in any professional area, there’s a community. One has colleagues, and it can be in any kind of professional area, whether it be blue collar or white collar or whatever—you have a community of colleagues with whom you associate. And, you have the opportunity in that community to influence your colleagues because you’re a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They soon come to know that—in fact, as Latter-day Saints, we try to make sure they know that.
								p In fact, that was very much true in my professional scholarly interaction with my colleagues. Even if I didn’t mention it to them, the fact that I was from Brigham Young University spoke volumes. If there was any question, it often led to a colleague asking me, ‘Well then, are you a Mormon?’ I could reply in the affirmative, and that would sometimes lead to discussions that would allow me to share as much as the situation allowed. So that was a very positive part of being an LDS scholar—is that I’m a scholar who has faith.
								p And there were other wonderful colleagues who had faith as well, even if not LDS. I found that in some group settings, often when I would make a comment that drew upon the spiritual part of my being, one or two of my colleagues of faith would chime in with their agreement and their support, and their gratitude that I spoke up. So, that’s certainly a gratifying part of the journey as an LDS scholar.
								p.bold Spirit and reason as a teacher
								p That was, as I said, gratifying. But, I think where I found the journey to be the most impactful for me on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis was in my interactions with my students, and in the teaching component in what we do here. One of the reasons for that is I sensed very early, partly because of the story of how we had come to come here—but also in my very first interactions with students—I sensed that BYU students are, and I’m going to say hungry, for examples of how you can be an educated, successful professional, and whatever that meant because of the choice of major and journey that they were on—and at the same time a faithful Latter-day Saint. How do you combine faith and reason? I believe that LDS BYU students really want examples of that in their lives and are looking for it—and that they come to BYU for a number of reasons, and that that’s one of them . I felt like that was part of my mission for coming here. And, so that’s been part of my journey.
								p The way I’ve tried to fulfill that mission, both collectively and individually is that, well, collectively in the classroom, first of all, by the way I treated the students. I tried to represent someone who is a Latter-day Saint in I hope deed as well as word. And that I treated them not only cordially but with charity—and that with my policies I erred on the side of charity. But that also, when we had a moment in class, whether prompted by something we were talking about in class, or simply because there were a few extra minutes at the end of what I wanted to talk about before the bell had rung, I would say something to them about the gospel—I would share a spiritual thought, an encouragement.
								p I didn’t—at first I thought I might try to connect it with whatever we’d been talking about—but I found I didn’t need to. I could say, ‘Before you go, I’ve just been thinking about you , and thinking about something I feel strongly about. Can I share it with you?’ And I found from the very beginning, students were very grateful for that. That collective effort was appreciated and was effective for them, as many expressed that ‘That really helped me. I really needed to hear that. And I needed to hear it from you.’
								p The other thing that I felt was part of that mission to help them bring faith and reason together was to come to know them personally. So, starting very early in my tenure here, I began learning my students’ names. Even before we had the university providing picture class rolls for us, I would take pictures of the students on the first day of class. They probably thought that I was lining them up for some sort of criminal investigation, but I learned their names, and they appreciated that very much.
								p That led to being able to talk to them more personally, and I learned a little bit about them and had them fill out information sheets and found out where they were from and where they’d gone on their missions and other things they were interested in. Sometimes they would ask questions of me on their personal information sheet, and I would refer to it. That was a wonderful beginning to friendships that led to students more than a few times coming to my office to talk, even when it wasn’t about the class, and asking my advice for a concern. And that has led to some wonderful experiences.
								p The opportunity sometimes would come because I had asked a student who was struggling to come in to talk to me. I could provide some support, some help, not only in the way of counsel, but even in marshaling university resources when that was merited—to the counseling center or other places—and could get involved in helping them when they struggled. Sometimes it was even more personal and short-term than that. A very treasured opportunity was some of those moments when a student asked me for a priesthood blessing. I felt honored to give that priesthood blessing, and felt like it was once again bringing together what was in the world’s terms academic and reason with spirit—and that they’re not separable.
								p.bold Influencing future faculty
								p It’s been very gratifying. Among the gratifying elements of this journey have been a number of circumstances in which some of my former students have come back to the university as new faculty members. I’ve been very pleased that they have expressed to me their desire and have shown to me by example that they want to do some of the same things that they learned from me about how they treat students here at BYU. So, those are some of the elements of being an LDS scholar in my take on that term and in my application of the concept.

								p.bold Questions about evolution and religion
								p You know, even though my dad was a scientist, we never really talked about evolution in my home, and I didn’t really know how to form an opinion.
								p When I was on my mission, there were several tapes that would float around the missionary apartments, and one was from Bruce R. McConkie: ‘The Seven Deadly Heresies,’ where, basically, he spelled out that evolution was against—or at least I felt—the doctrines of the Church. So I felt that coming to BYU, my professors would probably feel the same way. I just assumed that that was Church doctrine. And so when my professors started to talk about evolution as though, you know—they very matter-of-factly talked about it—I had no other choice than to think that my professors were out on the fringe of the Church, and it really troubled me.
								p Fortunately, I had the opportunity to work in the lab of Scott Woodward (he’s no longer here). One Sunday night, there was a CES fireside where an Apostle had basically, again, kind of told why evolution really is against the doctrines of the Church. So I was troubled about that, and my professor brought it up the next day and opened up our conversation. And then I just kind of let it all out: ‘I’m really struggling with this; I don’t know what to think.’ He took me into his office, and he opened up the scriptures. He talked to me about the temple, you know, as best you can outside of the temple. And then he showed me some documents where the Church has no official stance on evolution.
								p I remember just being so relieved, and I could see that he was a spiritual guy—he had the Holy Ghost with him as he went over all the doctrines of the Church and how the two didn’t have to be incompatible. I hate to think what might have happened had I left BYU with this difficult idea in my mind that I had to make a choice, either between the Church or evolution. I’m just really grateful—I mean, of course I’d had many spiritual experiences; I knew that God lived—but I’m thankful that he showed his spiritual side and opened up the scriptures and showed his spiritual side.
								p.bold Seeing his professors’ spiritual side
								p I was taking a genetics class, and Ralph Andersen—who’s no longer living—was my professor. He got up and he started teaching, and was kind of stammering around—was having a real difficulty with his lecture. Then he just stopped, and he said, ‘Can we sing a hymn together?’ And we’re just thinking, ‘This is a science class, but yeah.” We stood up and he led us in ‘Come Ye Children of the Lord.’ Then as we sat down—you know, and it brought the Spirit into the room—when we sat down, he said, ‘Thanks, I really needed that.’ Then he proceeded to give his lecture. But reflecting on that, I really needed that too. I needed to see that my professor wasn’t some professor out on the fringe but was a deeply spiritual person and had that side to him.
								p.bold Becoming a professor at BYU
								p Since you asked why—or how—I came to BYU, I was just getting ready to send my applications off. I was actually a primary teacher in my ward, and the bishop asked that all the primary teachers take a teacher development class. In the first class, the teacher said, ‘I want you do think back on a teacher that’s really influenced you.’ I started thinking about a professor that I had at BYU. I thought, ‘I really should just tell him how much he’s influenced me.’
								p So I sent him an email outlining a few things that he had done that really changed my life. He emailed back and said, ‘Thank you very much; that means a lot. You know, we teach a lot of kids and you wonder if you’re ever getting through with those sorts of things.’ And he said, ‘You know, we have a job search going on, and I just want to invite you to apply.’ I thought, ‘Well, I’m applying for jobs right now; maybe this would be a good opportunity,’ but still not really thinking of coming to BYU, because I really loved research.
								p I came out to BYU for an interview, and I met with Kent Crookston, who is the dean of our college. I should mention that prior to this point I’d been in school for a long time. It was really hard on my wife and on my kids, and there were plenty of times where I just—mainly due to the encouragement of my wife—started looking for other things to do. But every time I did, it was like something would bring me back.
								p When I was meeting with Kent Crookston, he started telling me about a talk that President Eyring—who was then Elder Eyring—had given about his vision of BYU. I can’t even really remember what President Eyring’s vision of BYU really was; all I can tell you was that I was so overcome by the Holy Ghost that I felt like this is where—that the Lord had been preparing me to come here. So that was, I guess, why I came here.
								p We actually came to two interviews—two different departments. The second time we came out—had the same interview with Kent Crookston—and this time my wife was with me, and this time she was totally overcome with the Holy Ghost. So we felt like that was the Lord telling us that this is where we should be—and I’ve never regretted coming here. It’s just been a great opportunity.
								p.bold Integrating spiritual and secular knowledge
								p I think it’s possible to interpret Brigham Young’s statement that ‘don’t teach the alphabet without the spirit of God’—the first time I heard that statement I felt like somehow I needed to be squeezing gospel principles into everything that I’m teaching. But I don’t think that that’s exactly what he meant. I think that it’s possible to teach secular subjects while having the Holy Ghost in you. I don’t see much of a difference teaching a Sunday School lesson versus teaching a lesson in developmental biology. I feel like I can receive inspiration on how to teach something just like I would teaching the Restoration to twelve-year-olds—I mean, I have to teach that differently than maybe I would to a Gospel Doctrine class.
								p I feel like I have received inspiration on how to teach certain principles. Even when I’m up on my feet, something might come to me. So, I feel like teaching secular subjects can be done with the Holy Ghost.
								p President Eyring said that he once saw his father give a seminar on kinetics in chemistry, and as he was listening to his father, he said, ‘My dad’s bearing his testimony.’ He talked to his dad afterwards–he said, ‘You were bearing your testimony.’ His dad said, ‘You know, I guess I was.’ But I’m positive he wasn’t saying, ‘I know that the Lord lives or that the gospel has been restored or that President so-and-so is a prophet of the Church.’ I’m sure that he just had the Holy Ghost with him as he was talking about his scientific principles. So, that’s kind of the way I approach it.
								p.bold Sharing testimony with students
								p I have two or three lectures on evolutionary development biology. When you think about the different forms on our planet, most of these changes occur during embryonic development. What are the sorts of the changes that have occurred?
								p Before giving that lecture, I tell them my story that I essentially just told you—that I really felt like my professors were out on the fringe and that they weren’t spiritual people. I just tell them, ‘In the event that you might think that I’m one of those professors out on the edge, I want to bear you my testimony that I know that God lives. And that I don’t necessarily feel that the principles of evolution and God are two separate thing—that we don’t have to make a choice; that they can be compatible. So if any of you are struggling, I’d be happy to talk with you about this. Occasionally, I do get people that come and talk to me. More often I receive an email: ‘Thank you for sharing your testimony with us today. I needed to hear that.'
								p.bold Praying in the classroom
								p Another thing—that was really a suggestion from my wife—was that I start every class with prayer. I remember thinking, ‘Well, I never prayed in my classes—my science classes—when I was at BYU. I wonder what my students will think about that.’ That has been the biggest piece of inspiration, I think, for my wife. My students always pray for me, that I’ll give a lecture that they’ll understand. [smiles] I never know quite how to take that, you know—like maybe I’m not making any sense. But I’ve decided not to be offended by that, but that they’re really praying for me that I’ll be able to give a lecture that they’ll be able to understand.
								p So they pray for me. They pray for themselves that they’ll also understand. I think it just starts the class on a great note. And now I feel very uncomfortable if I ever start anything without prayer. I feel like that’s just been a great experience.
								p It also gives me the opportunity to pray in front of my students—I take my turn along with them. I have seen student comments that ‘You know, I really like to hear him pray for our class.'
								p.bold Showing love to students
								p Our students somehow have to understand that we love them. If that doesn’t come through, I just feel like a lot of the things that I want to happen aren’t going to happen. So, I think every professor has to probably come up with their own way on how they’re going to do that.
								p What I do—one of the things I do—is that I learn every student’s name before the first day of class. Of course, I feel like for the Socratic Method, that is just absolutely essential. If they know that you know their name, it goes so much more differently than if I were just pointing to him or to her.
								p There’s something just kind of magical that happens when students know that you’ve taken some time to learn their name. All of a sudden they feel a sense of belonging. Instead of being a little shadow out in the sidelight that just shows up every day, they know that I know who they are.
								p.bold Purpose of showing love to students
								p [Laughs] I think it is test scores, and I think it is something else. I’ve had several students that have written and have said, ‘I usually just come to class and just kind of sit there and then I leave, and I might daydream or whatever—but because I knew that you knew my name, I knew that I needed to be prepared. I knew that you might call on me; I knew that I existed in your frame of mind; I knew that I needed to be prepared.’
								p I think that you’re also more approachable to come and get help. I definitely feel like because they like coming to class, and because they sense the love that I have for them and the subject that I’m teaching, that it does help.
								p I think it helps in so many other ways too. You never know what these students are encountering in their lives. Again, this is something that Kent Crookston taught me: always look out for those—in every class there are students that have struggles—and you never know exactly what background these students came from; what kind of support system that they have.
								p I think that showing them that kind of love helps those kinds of students to succeed, whereas, they might not have otherwise.”

									| )
								p.bold Baptism: Mother’s influence
								p In my patriarchal blessing it talks about my mother, and it specifically says, ‘Brother St. Clair, you have been taught the eternal principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christ at the knees of your good mother.’ My mother gave me both a love of the restored Gospel and its powerful message of hope and salvation as well as a deep and abiding love for plants. This from a woman who did not finish the ninth grade, but who had a remarkable sense of what was important to her family and particularly to her second son. She saw in me a deep inclination towards faith and a love of living things, and she had a remarkable capacity for nurturing both my faith and my love of science at the earliest and perhaps most vulnerable points.
								p In spite of the fact that our family was largely inactive in the church for more than ten years, my mother often made sure that I knew how she felt about three things. First, the Book of Mormon. She had a testimony of the Book of Mormon and wanted me to know that.
								p She also loved David O. McKay, so she regularly referred to President McKay. In fact, I can remember very distinctly her saying, ‘You know what? It’s my feeling that the next prophet will be President Brown.’ And at that time, I said, ‘Mother, I really don’t think so.’ She said, ‘How would you possibly know that?’ I said, ‘Because he’s not in the right position in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.’ She was quite disappointed that she wasn’t able to pick out the next prophet.
								p The third thing that she loved were full-time missionaries, and she had two wishes for me. I won’t tell you what the first is; it’s much too embarrassing. But the second wish was that I should serve a full-time mission. At age eleven, after almost ten years of inactivity, my mother called the mission home in our hometown and asked them to send the missionaries to teach her son. They did and I was baptized at age eleven in August of 1961.
								p.bold First Grade: “Larry, you are really dumb”
								p My second first-grade teacher—I don’t remember her name, and perhaps it’s because the experience was so awful—gave me an experience that altered me for many, many years academically speaking. I can still remember we had gone out to recess, and when we came back in, we dutifully filed in to our seats because this teacher was stern and very demanding. We were all, at least me—I can’t speak for the other students in the class—but I was absolutely terrified of this woman.
								p We sat down in our seats, and she said, ‘Now I’m going to have someone count to 100.’ I thought, ‘Oh, my goodness sakes alive. I hope she doesn’t call on me, because I can’t get any further than eleven.’ Part of my problem was that due to an illness—I had had some surgery when I was four and had not been able to attend kindergarten—I couldn’t read, I couldn’t say my ABCs, I couldn’t count except to ten or eleven.
								p Sure enough, all the kids kind of ducked their heads, and I remember very distinctly thinking, ‘Larry, she’s going to call on you.’ I thought, ‘No, she can’t. I can’t do this.’ Sure enough, she said, ‘Larry St. Clair, stand up beside your desk. Count to 100.’ So I stood up dutifully and I did ‘One…two…’ I thought, ‘Maybe I can drag this out for two hours. Who knows?’ But getting to ten I knew was going to be a real challenge, and taking two hours to do it was unreasonable.
								p So, anyway, as I approached eleven and the length got longer and longer in between each number, the little girl behind me sensed that I had a need, so she whispered, ‘Twelve,’ and I got twelve, and I got thirteen, and I got fourteen. And then the teacher wised up, and she simply moved slightly to one side to where she could look at me and the little girl behind me. And the little girl behind me thought, ‘Larry, I was willing to help, but I am not willing to die for you.’
								p So I stood there, and I stood there, and I stood there. I just felt absolutely overwhelmed with the pressure. And then the teacher came down, and she stood right in front of me, and she shook her finger in my face and said, ‘Larry St. Clair, you are dumb.’ I can remember a cloud descended over my brain. I felt it; it was tangible. I thought, ‘I’ve worried about this. I thought that perhaps I might be dumb; and now it’s been confirmed by a teacher, and it must be true.’
								p It was four years before that cloud started to uncover my brain. I can remember many times sitting with my mother and my father and trying to do an assignment in a reading workbook or trying to solve a math problem–and that cloud would come down, and I would know clearly that I was not capable of doing that.
								p.bold Fifth Grade: “Larry, you are really smart”
								p An interesting thing happened in the fifth grade. I do remember Miss Dash, and I remember that she was a remarkable, loving, supportive teacher. I started to learn how to read, and I started to learn how to be a student. Again I had a singular experience.
								p One day Miss Dash was working with us in the dictionary, and she had passed out to each of us a dictionary. The game was she would call out a word and we would look it up in the dictionary as quick as we could, and when we had found it we raised our hands. I can remember two words in a row I simply opened the dictionary and it was at the word. I thought, ‘Heaven forbid. I actually found the word in the dictionary.’ I said, ‘Miss Dash, I found it. It’s here,’ and she’d come look. She said, ‘That’s great.’ And then the next one I did the same thing.
								p She came at that point in time and stood beside me, put her hand on my shoulder, and said, ‘Larry, you are really very smart.’ I thought to myself, ‘Could it be? Could it be that the first grade teacher was wrong and Miss Dash is right?’ I can remember in my resilient heart, my heart told me, ‘Miss Dash has got it right.'
								p.bold Eleventh Grade: Mrs. Miller’s influence
								p I had started out in Virginia in Algebra 2 in the eleventh grade, and I remember very distinctly when we moved to Oklahoma my father planned our move based upon Thanksgiving holiday so we wouldn’t miss any school. I remember the teacher in Virginia had made an assignment in our Algebra 2 book and it was on page 100. I remembered it very well. As we traveled to Oklahoma, I diligently completed the assignment, assuming that I would turn it in on Monday in Oklahoma to my new Algebra 2 teacher.
								p I walked into Algebra 2, Mrs. Miller’s class in Oklahoma, sat down, new student in the school—didn’t have a clue what was going on but knew that I had my assignment for Algebra 2 completed. Mrs. Miller said, ‘Open your books to page 232.’ I thought, ‘Oh, my goodness, that doesn’t sound good at all.’ So I turned to the girl beside me, and I said, ‘Say that again. What page number did she say?’ She said, ‘232.’ I thought, ‘My goodness. It was Thanksgiving break. What have these people been doing during the break that they’re 132 pages ahead of me?’ I didn’t understand or hear a thing for the rest of the class period.
								p I walked up to Mrs. Miller at the end of the class, and I said, ‘Mrs. Miller, I’m new in the school, new in the class, and I just came from Virginia where our assignment in this same book was on page 100, and today you’ve been working on page 232.’ Now, I’ll be honest with you. I thought she would probably say to me, ‘Why don’t you go downstairs and drop this class and add typing.’ That’s not what she said. She said, ‘Larry, how much guts do you have?’ I can remember very distinctly thinking, ‘Most of it’s on the floor in the back of the room there,’ but she wouldn’t let me go. She said, ‘Will you come early in the morning?’ ‘I will.’ ‘Will you come in the afternoon after school?’ ‘I will.’ And she said, ‘Then you get started. We’ll catch you up before Christmas holiday.’
								p So every morning I would come in early, and Mrs. Miller would help me. Every afternoon I would stay late and she would help me. So for the whole rest of that term we worked morning and afternoon to get me caught up. I can remember times going up to her desk and asking the same question six or seven times. Never once did she scold me. Never once did she question my right to ask her yet again the same question. She loved us all, and she inspired us all. At the end of that term, with her good graces, she gave me a D. I continued to work. At the end of my junior year, Miss Miller passed out our score card for that year, and she had given me an A. She made it very clear. ‘Larry, you earned this A.’ I thought to myself, ‘No, Mrs. Miller, you and I together earned that A.'
								p.bold Mission: “I will be completely committed”
								p One day I was particularly discouraged. I’d been reading my New Testament and the mail came. One of the missionaries said the mail was down in the office, so I went down and there was a letter from my father there. That was the first sign that something was wrong. My dad never wrote to me, and if my dad had written to me, there was something drastically wrong.
								p I opened the letter up and my dad’s letter was very short. He said, ‘Dear Larry, your mother’s in the hospital. She’s quite sick. We don’t know what’s going to happen. I’ll let you know as much as I can when I find something out. Love, Dad.’ That was the end of the letter. They were in Germany, I was in Hawaii. This was 1969. I had no idea how to place a phone call to Germany from Hawaii, so I knew the only thing I could do was wait for the next letter.
								p I went back to my room, and I can remember I knelt down by my bed and I said, ‘I am really unhappy, and I’m particularly disappointed in You for, number one, calling me to Japan. And now my mother’s sick. What kind of deal is this? Here I am trying to be a missionary, trying to learn this awful language, and you’re going to do this to me too?’
								p I was very angry and very upset. I sat back up on the bed, and I opened Matthew back up again. I had stopped at verse thirty-seven in chapter ten. This is what verses thirty-seven to thirty-nine said: ‘He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me. He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.’ I realized I was confident that Matthew had written that for Elder St. Clair.
								p I knelt back down by the bed, and in tears I said, ‘I am so sorry. I have missed the whole point. I have failed to understand that You are the first priority in my life, but I promise You from now on there will be no question—that I will be completely committed, and I will be an honorable and faithful servant in Japan or wherever You need me.'
								p.bold Undergraduate: “You want to get a graduate degree, right?”
								p When I came home from the mission, I met a fellow by the name of Sam Rushforth. He was a faculty member in the botany department at the time. He was teaching a plant kingdom course. It was over in the Marb Building, one of the large lecture halls. There were 250 students in the class. Somehow or the other Sam Rushforth figured out that I was in that class, and he singled me out.
								p I can remember at the end of the semester, and it was just halfway through my junior year, Sam pulled me aside and he said, ‘What are your plans?’ I said, ‘Well, I’ve decided I want to teach high school biology.’ He said, ‘No, you don’t,’ and I said, ‘I don’t?’ He said, ‘No, you don’t want to teach high school biology. You want to get a graduate degree, right?’ I said, ‘I don’t know. I don’t know that I can do that.’ He said, ‘You can do that.’ So I spent the rest of my undergraduate experience and my first time as a graduate student for a master’s degree working with Sam Rushforth. I never would have done that on my own if Sam had not expressed confidence that I could do that.
								p.bold Professor: Commitment to the one
								p I had another experience teaching Biology 100. I used to take and prepare a roll when I was teaching in sections of 250, and I would circulate it through the class and have them mark the roll. I’d tell them flat out, ‘You miss three days, I’m going to give you a call.’
								p In this one class one year, I remember very distinctly I got behind in tracking the roll and seeing who was not there. Then I noticed in some communication I had that a student had committed suicide, and I found out what his name was. I thought, ‘Oh, my goodness, I think he’s in my class.’ So I went back to the roll, and I thumbed through and there was BW’s name. He had missed four days in a row, and I had missed the opportunity to call BW and tell him I missed him and that I cared about him and that I was anxious to help him. I found out later on that BW had a lot of issues, but I can tell you that gave me a renewed commitment to the one, to the individual student, to make sure that I did everything in my power to make a difference for them.
								p.bold Priorities: Husband, father, teacher
								p There are a couple things I’ve learned about setting priorities and honoring those priorities. My major professor at the University of Colorado for several years came over and spent some time with us here at BYU. He was retired at that point.
								p One day in the lab he pulled me aside, and he said, ‘Larry, I have something I need to tell you. You have the capacity to be a world-class lichenologist.’ (Now, I’m telling you, there aren’t very many of us. It wouldn’t have been a tough stretch anyway.) He said, ‘You have the capacity to be a world-class lichenologist, but I’m going to tell you you never will be.’
								p I thought, ‘Where is Sam going with this?’ (Sam Shushan from the University of Colorado.) And then he said, ‘But let me tell you why. You spend way too much time with your family, you spend way too much time with your church, and you spend way too much time with Biology 100 students.’ He said, ‘But I think you’re doing the right thing.’
								p I can tell you this day that I don’t ever care to be known as a world-class lichenologist. I love lichens. I love doing research with them. I’ve published things and I’ve done all of that–but I can tell you I would much rather be known as a world-class dad, a world-class husband, and a world-class teacher of Biology 100 students at BYU.

								p (This is an excerpt from Dr. Faulconer's&nbsp;
									a(href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7NNs6jPxww" target="_blank") full lecture
									| )
								p My parents left west-central Missouri via the U.S. Army for opportunity, and to my great benefit they found it. My father started work as a blacksmith when he quit school at the end of the eighth year in school. He needed to help his father to earn money for the family. When the United States entered World War II he volunteered, believing that he was going to learn to be a gunsmith—that’s what the recruiter had led him to believe—assigned instead to be a medic. That began his life in the Army, which he entered as a private and he left twenty-seven years later as a lieutenant colonel in the Regular Army.
								p My mother came from a similar background. She was from a large farm family a few miles down the road. Though she went to school longer than me father, she also didn’t finish high school. She married at 17 and gave birth to me at 18. She lives in Orem now, unable to leave her house easily because of her age. But I remember her as younger and prettier than anyone else’s mother at school, and as always adventuresome. As our family moved from place to place around the world following my father, she was always happy to live off of the local economy as much as we could, to get to know local culture and food, to see the sights of where we lived, and to try to pick up at least some of the language. To be in my mother’s family was to come to love whatever place we lived in.
								p Though my father didn’t go to high school, he did take some courses at the college in Warrensburg, Missouri, after the war. He also took a number of courses that were offered through the University of Maryland by the Army. But other than that no one in my family, immediate or otherwise, graduated from high school, much less been to college. That meant in my family that I was going to go to college. Me not going to college was absolutely unimaginable. And so, because it was unimaginable to my parents, it was equally unimaginable to me.
								p One of my first classes after returning to BYU was a history of philosophy class from David H. Yarn. I have to confess that I didn’t do very well—something that Brother Yarn remembered all too well when I returned as a professor. We were standing outside the mailboxes in the old JSB one day. I had just gotten to BYU and I had a mailbox—that was really impressive to me. And it had a little dialing lock on it—I was in heaven. I was a real professor now. And I was getting my mail out and Brother Yarn came up and said, “You’re Brother Faulconer, right?” And I said, “Yes.” And he said, “Didn’t you take Philosophy 201 from me?” And I said, “I did.” And he said, “And didn’t you get a B+?” And I could have just crawled underneath the tile in the floor, because yes, I got a B+, and it was probably his grace that gave that to me. So the class was not that good for me, and I was not that good for the class.
								p But I had a brief, very important experience in his class—one that changed my life. It was an experience that had almost nothing to do with the content of the course but had everything to do with character: I took the mid-term examination, knowing that I had not studied well enough, and so I knew ahead of time I was not going to do well on this examination. When I finished, I was feeling guilty, I was trying to hide my shame. I took my examination, walked to the front of the room where Brother Yarn was standing. And if you know him, you know he had this very gentle hunched looked about him—a wonderful person. And so, trying very hard not to look him in the eye, I handed my examination to him. He took it in both hands, he said “Thank you”—and Brother Yarn said “Thank you” so sincerely that it shocked me. He was thanking me for taking his examination, and he really was thanking me, not just being polite. Now I don’t remember—I have to confess—I don’t remember anything we did in that class, except since it was history of ancient philosophy, we must have done some Plate and Aristotle and a little Medieval or something, but that’s all I can tell you. But I remember that moment like it happened yesterday. I learned something about what it meant to be a genuine human being from Brother David Yarn.
								p It’s always difficult to do philosophy without thinking about what the ideas that one studies and what they have to do with one’s life, particularly with religious life. It’s difficult to do psychology without wondering what it has to do with things like agency and morality. So my teaching and writing had always had, at least in the background, those kind of questions about the connections between philosophy and my faith.
								p I had always been willing to raise or respond to such questions in my classes as well as with students over pizza or during office hours, but I have to confess that for a long time I felt somewhat nervous about doing so. I would ask myself, “What right do I have to do that? What if I’m wrong, as at some level I know am?” When I talked to students about such things, I wondered if perhaps I was abusing my authority as a professor—my forcing ideas on them I have no right to force. And I asked, “Aren’t students in my classed there to learn the topic advertised in the course catalogue rather than how I think that topic relates to faith?” Those questions didn’t keep me from thinking about the relationship between my work and my faith, but they made me somewhat nervous about bringing the two together in the classroom or in my writing. Nevertheless, the more I read, and the more I thought, and the more I tried to write about my ideas, the more I began to ask “What has Athens to do with Jerusalem—or Salt Lake City?”
								p Now, I still wasn’t sure—and I’m still not completely sure—how the criticism of modernity on the one hand and the Restoration’s implicit criticism of the contemporary world fit together, if they do at all.
								p In the beginning I spent a lot of time just trying to understand the philosophical criticisms of moderntiy. I had to learn more about the history of philosophy than I ever imagined I would need from Brother Yarn’s class. I think if he had seen what I learned he would finally have felt good about what I did. I had to try to understand not only what each of the thinkers I studied was saying, but how they differed from one another. And I was sure there were important implications for their work, but I really had a hard time thinking much further than asking what those implications meant for psychology. Getting hold of the ideas I was reading took energy and time. Though I continued to be interested in what they might help me understand about faith, I still couldn’t spend a lot of time working that out. Only within perhaps the last fifteen years has it been possible for me to try to bring these things together in some fashion to be able to find an opportunity so that I can say something about how they fit together in a public way.
								p Now, from my first philosophy class to yesterday—or this morning, or even an hour ago—it’s been common for people to either express shock that we teach philosophy at BYU or to express their admiration that I have been able to spiritually survive studying philosophy. My mission president’s wife literally broke into tears when she learned that I was going to graduate school in philosophy. She said to me, “You will leave the Church.” I’m happy to say she’s still alive and she knows that I didn’t. Now, others have been less demonstrative than she was, but they have held the same suspicion. Many fear philosophy. But I have to say, it has never created any difficulties for me. Sometimes it had nothing to do with my faith one way or the other. But when it had anything to do with my faith, it strengthened it.
								p Now, I’ve several times tried to think about why that would be, and I think—my guess is—it’s because when I joined the Church as a teenager, I had an experience with the Spirit that was so profound I could not deny it. Not then; not later. To deny that experience would be to deny my being. I can’t say it didn’t happen—that I didn’t know. And that’s been a touchstone for my life. When I have had issues or difficulties, it’s something to which I can return for strength and reassurance. But more often it’s been for me something that makes reassurance unnecessary. For question has seldom been for me, “Is the gospel true?” Instead, it’s almost always been “What does it mean?” Because of that experience through which I was converted, my lack of understanding of this or that doctrine, my surprise at discovering something unexpected in our history, a disappointment at some trusted leader’s moral failure, none of these kinds of things has been an occasion for doubt about the gospel itself. Sometimes those experiences have reminded me of my mortality and the limits of human intelligence. Sometimes they have served as disappointments in human character and reminders not to trust in any arm of flesh, not even if that arm belongs to a church leader. Sometimes they are something to which I can respond only “I don’t know.” But none of them has been an occasion for doubt about the revelation I received as a 14-year-old boy.
								p As my career has gone its way, these kinds of questions have moved from things I think or talk about, to things I also try write and teach. And though I’ve thought about them for years, and I’ve talked about them with some frequency, now they have become mostly what my thinking and writing is about. I have less confidence that I know what the answers to those questions are. But I have more confidence that we are in need of rethinking our world as a whole and that contemporary philosophy at least raises the right questions—the questions we need to ask. And I also have more confidence that to some degree it helps us think about alternatives. I also have more confidence than ever that the gospel of Jesus Christ is a genuine alternative to the way of being-in-the-world that is essential to modernity. In spite of ourselves, we are not Moderns. I also have more confidence that what the Restoration brings to the intellectual table can make a difference, though I have difficulty being confident that we know what that difference is.
								p Latter-day Saints seldom understand how different and unusual our beliefs really are. We know that we are Christians and, knowing that, nevertheless, we know relatively little about the beliefs of other peoples. So, when we look at ourselves, it seems to us that we look like they look—we look like other Christians look. We don’t recognize a huge chasm between ourselves and them. It’s that chasm that right now in the contemporary political sphere scandalizes them, and that we simply cannot see. We don’t get it. That chasm makes it possible for us to live in a world quite different from others, and it has important implications, but at least right now, I think, we don’t think much about those differences and about what they mean—not enough.
								p Let me give you a couple examples from philosophy. And there are other examples from other areas as well, I’m sure. But because we are ultimately materialists, though certainly not simple materialists, we find it much easier than many other religious people to take science seriously. Because we are fundamentally communal beings, rather than merely individuals, are relationship to God is an individual one but also one that comes through family, and through priesthood. Because of that, we have the intellectual resources, I believe, for thinking about alternatives to contemporary individuality. Because we believe there have been dispensations and apostasies over the generations of time, in principle it should be easier for us to imagine that modernism is flawed, that the history of civilization is not just one wonderful scene of progress, and that there are ancient and medieval ideas that might help us understand ourselves and the world, if we re-think them in a new context. Philosophy has helped me think much about our own understanding and in ways we may not yet be able to explicate. It’s also helped me think that we ought to think about what philosophy has to say that is different than what others say and what the gospel has to say that is different than what others say.
								p Now of course, one danger of thinking about the implications of Mormonism is that we will rush too quickly to our conclusions, sure that we know what the Restoration means and sure that we know how what it means impinges on contemporary questions. It’s a danger I often see in student essays: reading something by Heidegger or Levinas or someone else, they think, “Hey, he says X.  The gospel says Y. I know how to put those together.” Now, sometimes they actually understand Levinas or Heidegger better than they understand the gospel. They think they know because they can repeat something they learned in primary. But they haven’t really given it a lot of thought. So they put these things together, and it doesn’t work very well. Students aren’t the only ones who I think make that mistake.
								p But the other, equal danger is that we will not enter into that discussion of the gospel’s implications at all. We will cordon off our lives into regions that remain unrelated to each other, placing faith in one region, our daily affairs in another region, our university studies in another, and so on—allowing each to continue with as little effect on the other as possible. To do that is to fail to be converted or is to fail to remain converted: for the convert is the one who comes to new life as a whole, not just to a new view of religion or faith and the same old views of everything else. When we are converted, everything should be different.
								p So, the task of faithful scholarship is to find some balance between unjustified surety on one hand and unjustified reticence on the other. Now, I search for that balance. I don’t know whether I found it or not. And I think the answer to whether or not I have is something that only time will tell.
								p Probably nothing has contributed more to my thinking about philosophy and my faith than my teaching. That’s been central to everything else that I do.  For it’s in the classroom, and it’s face-to-face with students where this question of their relationship to me and to each other is unavoidable. It usually remains unspoken, but it can’t be avoided. Teaching means thinking about the truth of what I teach. It means asking myself what matters. It means asking myself how to help students know what matters. And I’ve come to realize, however, that more than anything else, it means remembering that in my experience character has always mattered more than content. The question for me, then, is how to bring character into class as an essential element.
								p Now, as with any other philosophical question, I don’t know the answer to that question. I don’t have a definitive answer. But wrestling with it has resulted in what has been, for me, the most important class that I’ve taught at BYU, a class in which we ask “What is the good life?” And in that course I’ve tried to bring reading philosophy texts and asking philosophical questions together with course policies that encourage us to think about the questions of the class and the class itself in terms of character. Students grade themselves. I insist that the Honor Code means honor in university work, and has less to do with dress—which is not to say that it doesn’t have to do with dress—but it has less to do with dress than with how we learn. I try to insist that learning is their responsibility—that we do this together. I work very hard to make character central to that course. And part of what we’re studying as we study is what do philosophers have to say about character—about the good, the true, the beautiful—and what it means to an individual. It’s been perhaps the most satisfying experience of my career, to finally figure out what I would like to have been teaching 36 years ago.
								p So it is with much wandering, I end up where I began, with David Yarn’s “Thank you.” I cannot thank him enough for that “Thank you.” I don’t know that I thank my students for their examinations and papers every time. I doubt that when I do I can do so as sincerely as Brother Yarn did. I do know that his simple gesture continues to define the way that I think about what I must do at BYU. It may not be what has defined my wandering, but it has certainly been a constant influence on that wandering. Thank you very much.

Various professors approach that in various ways, but I think dedicated professors all over this campus, in one way or another, find out who their students are, find out what their concerns are. Maybe it’s short bios they have them write. Maybe it’s 'What’s the most pressing issue going on in your life?' Maybe it’s taking the opportunity to invite one student, or a small group of students, throughout the semester, to their office just to chat for a few minutes. &hellip; Representative sampling will often serve our purposes well, so in a class of 200, we may not be able to meet and know each individual personally, but by meeting a few of them we can kind of know typical issues and typical struggles. In smaller classes such as I teach, I think it’s my duty to know them more intimately. When you know people, then you have the basis to begin to serve them as people. So that would be a starting point: know your students as individuals, as persons, their fears, their dreams, their troubles, their successes, their background. That is the beginning of being able to follow encouragement we all recently received: 'this semester, try teaching students, not the course.'"

If the only insights that students receive on gospel truths are in their religion classes, we will not be that different from other good universities to which an institute of religion is attached. What will truly make us unique—and what we must uniquely do well—is to meet the challenge set forth by President Spencer W. Kimball:<br/>'That every professor and teacher in this institution would keep his [or her] subject matter bathed in the light and color of the restored gospel and have all his [or her] subject matter perfumed lightly with the spirit of the gospel.'"

But the point is that I show them that I care about them, and I don’t just say it, I try to express it. And so it’s very gratifying to see a student really believe me when I say, 'Yeah, come talk to me, and we’ll spend an hour, two hours, whatever it takes.' I just try to put myself in their position—which is easy to do, because I’ve spent most of my life at school or research and always feeling like I’m struggling. But I think the important thing, for me, is to really get them to believe that I care about them and then prove it by doing some things that are extra: leaving my door open, pleading with them to come see me. That’s what I offer the students."

To be an instrument in the lives of these individuals, to help enlighten their lives, to help increase their capacity to appreciate who they are and the world around them and their capacity to engage with other people, to be an instrument in that process seems really an amazing opportunity. And I think if we can see it as a privilege that not just anybody would be entrusted with, I think it would be a much more enjoyable, meaningful experience."

The other extreme in my mind is [where] you’re so worried about bringing the Spirit in [that] it’s a seminary class and all the rigor vanishes, so it’s a spiritual high for the student, but they don’t learn anything. I think there’s a balance in there that we’ve got to find. We’ve got to have a rigorous class where it’s challenging, it’s educational, they’re learning things that the world is trying to learn, but they’re feeling the Spirit as they do it. And that’s not always an easy balance to get."

It may look different [for] different people; the means to the end may be different; but the result is the same. When a teacher serves as a conduit of the Spirit, there is a deep-seeded connection from one heart to another, where not only the concept, but also the love of God is communicated. The love of God is communicated either through miraculously knowing what [to say] or how to say something, or the miraculous empathic opening of your heart to the thoughts and feelings of another, or through the truth of a personal story that resonates for many others, or through the beauty and spirit of a piece of music, or through any other unique means and experience you bring to a situation. In addition to the concept, the love of God is also communicated."

And so what we do in our private faith and devotion is so imperative. An essential preparation for teaching is to make sure that the Spirit is in your home, before you come to class. In my experience, we carry the Spirit from home to work. Some days, a few extra minutes spent at home, getting your heart right there, doing what you need to do for there to be love at home, will be the most important preparation for teaching by the Spirit."

							p "Brigham Young’s instruction to Karl G. Maeser was, 'Remember to not teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God.' He did not say to always draw in gospel principles when teaching these secular topics. I believe that the Spirit can attend our teaching things that on the surface seem completely independent of the gospel, such as math and computer science, or engineering and physics even when we are not bearing explicit testimony of the gospel. I usually say a prayer before I go into the classroom and invite the Spirit in my preparation, in my delivery. I firmly believe that the Spirit can enlighten your teaching of material completely independent of what we normally think of as gospel doctrine. It can enlighten teaching of computer science and math and engineering and quicken our and our students' understanding. I’ve heard President Eyring speak of getting a testimony of the principle of thermodynamics. I believe that can happen, and it ought to be a commonplace experience at BYU when you invite the Spirit."
