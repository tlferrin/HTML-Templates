						p.title Spiritually Strengthening and Intellectually Enlarging Faculty: What Students Want (2011)
						article.abstract
							p ABSTRACT: 
							p What makes for a quality education at a religious university? In this research study, we asked both faculty and students at Brigham Young University to describe the factors that make a difference in an education that is both “spiritually strengthening and intellectually enlarging.” We explore the role that the gospel can play in secular learning and what students consider important in their courses and in their professors. One conclusion we draw from the data is that who the professor is (faculty characteristics) is more important that what the professors does (faculty techniques).

							p The founding charge of BYU is to teach every subject with the Spirit of God. As he sent Karl G. Maeser to Provo to lead the fledgling Brigham Young Academy, Brigham Young told him: “Brother Maeser, I want you to remember that you ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God.” Reflecting on that charge, Elder Spencer W. Kimball explained that it is not intended “that all of the faculty should be categorically teaching religion constantly in their classes, but . . . that every . . . teacher in this institution would keep his subject matter bathed in the light and color of the restored gospel.”
							p We have heard faculty across campus who desire to provide educational experiences to their students that are both “spiritually strengthening and intellectually enlarging” (Aims of a BYU Education) in the spirit of Brigham Young’s charge but who wonder how it can be done. Some have asked how they can cover everything necessary in their classes and still have time to incorporate gospel ideas. Others are concerned that praying in class or bringing up gospel topics may lead to less critical thinking and lower expectations for performance (a “Sunday School” approach). Still others are concerned that the &hellip;

						p.title What Students Don’t Like: Distinguishing the Least from the Most Successful Professors at Intellectually and Spiritually Strengthening (2013)
						article.abstract
							p ABSTRACT: 
							p During winter semester 2012, we collaborated with Dr. Robert Ridge to conduct a survey and focus groups to investigate what separates the most from the least successful BYU professors in terms of being spiritually and intellectually strengthening. Previously, our research had described what the most successful faculty do to be both spiritually and intellectually strengthening, but we had never investigated what the faculty members who are least successful do and how the most successful professors differed from them. We hypothesized that some of the things students said in previous research might be said of both successful and less successful professors. For example, it might be said that a lot of poor teachers assign a lot of homework, but the same might be said about many great teachers.
							p This article is a summary of the characteristics of faculty who BYU students identify as some of the least successful in being spiritually and intellectually strengthening. It is important to place this research into context. BYU students, in general, are very happy with their education and their professors at BYU. We also know that most faculty would like to do even better. Our hope is that by identifying what students think gets in the way of a positive intellectual and spiritual student experience, this report might assist faculty in their efforts to improve.

							p We worked with two applied social psychology classes taught by Dr. Ridge. With his class of graduate students we developed a survey that they administered to a random sample of 1200 undergraduate students in their sophomore or junior year at BYU. As part of the survey, we asked respondents if they would be willing to participate in a focus group to further explore the issues in the survey. We used their responses to place them into specific focus groups, which were moderated by the students in Dr. Ridge’s undergraduate class. These students also recorded and transcribed the focus group discussions. This report presents the most common themes from comments made by students &hellip;

						p.title Three Questions Students Seem to be Asking&nbsp;
							span (in progress)
						article.abstract
							p DESCRIPTION: 
							p In a previous paper we reported on the principal factors that students say make the greatest difference to them in whether a professor is both spiritually strengthening and intellectually enlarging (see Spiritually Strengthening and Intellectually Enlarging Faculty: What Students Want, 2011).  Based on subsequent surveys and focus groups, we have grouped these factors into three questions that students seem to be asking (whether explicitly or implicitly) of their instructors: (1) Who are you? (2) Who am I to you? and (3) Why does this course matter? In this paper, we will discuss what each question entails and what faculty can do to answer them in ways that are spiritually strengthening and intellectually enlarging to students.

						p.title Teaching by the Spirit&nbsp;

						article.abstract
							p DESCRIPTION: 
							p During the Winter 2014 semester, the Faculty Center teamed up with Dr. Bob Ridge’s Applied Social Psychology class to interview 19 faculty members across campus about their experiences with teaching by the Spirit. For one week prior to the interviews, faculty were asked to keep a record of experiences during that week when they felt inspired by the Spirit of God in their teaching. Dr. Ridge's students then interviewed each professor and 1-2 students in his or her class.
							hr
						article.status
							p STATUS:
							p As we delve into these interview transcripts, we are learning that the Spirit of the Lord is working through professors on our campus every day, and this can look very different from one professor to the next. We hope to have a finished report of this project to share with you soon.

						p.title Distinguishing Most from Least Successful: A Second Try&nbsp;
							span (in progress)
						article.abstract
							p DESCRIPTION: 
							p In 2012, the BYU Faculty Center worked with psychology graduate students to conduct a survey to determine what makes BYU professors both spiritually strengthening and intellectually enlarging, as defined by <a href="http://aims.byu.edu/" target="_blank">The Aims of a BYU Education</a>. The strategy used in this survey was to analyze differences in the extremes and thus bring to light some of the more prominent differences between professors who were rated high in both aspects from those who are rated low in both aspects. The 2012 survey however, had a low response rate (17%), and conveyed a ceiling effect for professors who were rated high on spiritually strengthening and intellectually enlarging. This made it more difficult to ascertain which specific qualities differentiate professors who are rated high in both areas from those who are rated low in both areas.  In order to obtain more useful information, an edited version of the 2012 online survey was constructed and administered in early 2014, with modifications aimed at: (1) increasing participation and (2) reducing the ceiling effects that were found in the 2012 survey.
