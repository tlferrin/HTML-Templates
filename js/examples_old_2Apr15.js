If the only insights that students receive on gospel truths are in their religion classes, we will not be that different from other good universities to which an institute of religion is attached. What will truly make us unique—and what we must uniquely do well—is to meet the challenge set forth by President Spencer W. Kimball:\n'That every professor and teacher in this institution would keep his [or her] subject matter bathed in the light and color of the restored gospel and have all his [or her] subject matter perfumed lightly with the spirit of the gospel' (BYU Annual University Conference, August 2014).",

I started sharing with them times when I was laid off in between productions, because they all struggle with that exact same fear. And what do you do? … Well, I get on my mountain bike, I go pray to God that another animation film is around the corner, that’s what I did. And … when I started sharing those experiences and how they relate to the gospel, boy, their eyes just got huge, and they soaked up the information, and they became more and more receptive to that kind of a teaching of personal experience.",

And if you do, you walk into the classroom, and the sharing—of who you are, and the effort that goes with it, and the openness, and everything that has to be there—will be there. And the students will trust you. They’ll open up their hearts and minds to be taught both the information and the more spiritual aspects of it. You know, you can put together a long list of things we should be doing, but unless (1) we’re striving to be who we need to be, and (2) we truly do love our students, I don’t know how much good the rest of the list does you.",

It may look different [for] different people; the means to the end may be different; but the result is the same. When a teacher serves as a conduit of the Spirit, there is a deep-seeded connection from one heart to another, where not only the concept, but also the love of God is communicated. The love of God is communicated either through miraculously knowing what [to say] or how to say something, or the miraculous empathic opening of your heart to the thoughts and feelings of another, or through the truth of a personal story that resonates for many others, or through the beauty and spirit of a piece of music, or through any other unique means and experience you bring to a situation.

If you look at 3rd Nephi when Christ came, He taught them, ‘Go—pray and ponder and come back, and we’ll talk about it in the morning.' Why did he do that? Because the real learning doesn't take place in the lecture; it takes place when you do your homework; you have to put in the work to really internalize the lesson and make that knowledge and information your own. That's an eternal principle as much in religion as it is in mathematics, or whatever you are learning.",

But the point is that I show them that I care about them, and I don’t just say it, I try to express it. And so it’s very gratifying to see a student really believe me when I say, 'Yeah, come talk to me, and we’ll spend an hour, two hours, whatever it takes.' I just try to put myself in their position—which is easy to do, because I’ve spent most of my life at school or research and always feeling like I’m struggling. But I think the important thing, for me, is to really get them to believe that I care about them and then prove it by doing some things that are extra: leaving my door open, pleading with them to come see me. That’s what I offer the students.",

And if we allow enough time for the core principles, and be less concerned about every single last detail being communicated, and have faith that somewhere we’ll be able to make sure those details get covered, that gives us the flexibility in a class period to pursue a student’s question with a little more time and a little more depth than if we have the classroom period jammed with so many details and such a rigid structure that we don’t have any flexibility.",

These students that are struggling, I’ll sit down with them, and I will emphasize with them, 'I know that some of the impressions you may receive in this program are that this program and the class that you’re in should be the number one priority in your life. I’ll go out on a limb and tell you that it is not. And if it’s even anywhere in your top three, you probably ought to reevaluate your life. If your family and your God and your church are not in your top three priorities in your life and this class is, there’s a problem right there. You must get a balance in your life with those things at the top of your list.' And I can’t tell you how many students come back to me to tell me about that one statement. They often state that they had lost that focus and that priority. ...

Maybe just in your ward, or maybe somewhere else, but hopefully you’re going to take your gifts, your talents, the things you’re given, and you’re going to be able to give them back.' And I hope I’m an example of that for them, and they can say, 'I’m going to go out and do something, but maybe I’ll come back and be able to really apply these things someday to help build the Kingdom.'

I pray every day in class, not just at the beginning of the week, but every class. We need it. I need it, especially in light of some of the subjects we discuss. We’re taught to pray. It is that simple, right?\nThe students jump up and pray. Most of them are excited to do it. They know we’re going to pray, and it’s a great way to get started because everybody’s talking, someone’s going to pray, and everyone gets quiet, and then I have their attention, that’s also a benefit. It’s a simple thing. Let’s just pray every day. Let’s make sure whatever happens in here is going to be okay with Heavenly Father. That helps students to be more discriminating about the type of examples they bring into class. Maybe they’ll think: some are not such good examples now that I think about it, so they’ll maybe check them at the door.\nSome of those prayers are interesting because the students say things like, “We’re grateful for Professor Kelly for preparing…” Wow, what did I prepare? It’s like they’re counting on me. So sometimes that’s a call to action for me to prepare in a certain way. If we pray, they know I’m a praying person. At least they know that much about me, whatever else happens.",

And so what we do in our private faith and devotion is so imperative. An essential preparation for teaching is to make sure that the Spirit is in your home, before you come to class. In my experience, we carry the Spirit from home to work. Some days, a few extra minutes spent at home, getting your heart right there, doing what you need to do for there to be love at home, will be the most important preparation for teaching by the Spirit.",

Various professors approach that in various ways, but I think dedicated professors all over this campus, in one way or another, find out who their students are, find out what their concerns are. Maybe it’s short bios they have them write. Maybe it’s 'What’s the most pressing issue going on in your life?' Maybe it’s taking the opportunity to invite one student, or a small group of students, throughout the semester, to their office just to chat for a few minutes. ... Representative sampling will often serve our purposes well, so in a class of 200, we may not be able to meet and know each individual personally, but by meeting a few of them we can kind of know typical issues and typical struggles. In smaller classes such as I teach, I think it’s my duty to know them more intimately. When you know people, then you have the basis to begin to serve them as people. So that would be a starting point: know your students as individuals, as persons, their fears, their dreams, their troubles, their successes, their background. That is the beginning of being able to follow encouragement we all recently received: 'this semester, try teaching students, not the course.’",

It’s very rigorous: 'Here’s the facts, here’s how it works, learn it and that’s it.' The other extreme in my mind is [where] you’re so worried about bringing the Spirit in [that] it’s a seminary class and all the rigor vanishes, so it’s a spiritual high for the student, but they don’t learn anything. I think there’s a balance in there that we’ve got to find. We’ve got to have a rigorous class where it’s challenging, it’s educational, they’re learning things that the world is trying to learn, but they’re feeling the Spirit as they do it.

He did not say to always draw in gospel principles when teaching these secular topics. I believe that the Spirit can attend our teaching things that on the surface seem completely independent of the gospel, such as math and computer science, or engineering and physics even when we are not bearing explicit testimony of the gospel. I usually say a prayer before I go into the classroom and invite the Spirit in my preparation, in my delivery. I firmly believe that the Spirit can enlighten your teaching of material completely independent of what we normally think of as gospel doctrine. It can enlighten teaching of computer science and math and engineering and quicken our and our students' understanding. I’ve heard President Eyring speak of getting a testimony of the principle of thermodynamics.

While each is worthwhile, perhaps the most important thing, if we look at the Savior¹s teachings, is to be someone who truly treasures the gospel, to be someone who has a strong testimony, to be someone who is filled with faith, spirituality, and love. In short, to be as He is. Through your example as a teacher of being those things and not just outwardly saying or doing them, you will likely preach the greatest sermon.",

I certainly never try to wedge it in, like force it, but when it happens organically, I relish the academic freedom to bring in the gospel, and to talk about what the gospel would say about a situation we are discussing.\nFor me it’s important that it never be forced. Students should never feel like “Now we’re trying to improve the spiritually inspiring portion of the evaluation.” If it ever feels that way to me, it feels fake. I never consciously think about it, I never plan ahead. But at the same time, if there’s a time to bear testimony or share my feelings that is natural, I take advantage of that. I seize those moments when they happen, and I keep an eye out for them. They come to mind, by only in the moment.\nIt helps if I keep my own spirituality in check. Those moments won’t happen if I’m not going to the temple as often as I should, if I’m not reading my scriptures as often as I should, or not as engaged in my calling as I could be, or more argumentative with my children than I should be. Personal spirituality is a quest all of us, and it’s pretty hard to latch on to anything in the classroom spiritually if you’re not connected spiritually.",

When someone has a testimony, they don’t need to talk about it constantly, yet as you interact with them, you can feel their commitment to the gospel; that's communicated even without words. As teachers, we don’t always have to say, ‘I know this and this is true,’ however, sometimes it's crucial to be that honest and clear. If we feel something is significant, then we should stand up for it! We should own it. That kind of authenticity helps students learn how to do likewise in their own lives, careers, and families—in the places that matter most.",

Right up front on the first day of orientation, I say to them, ‘I will be very clear that our expectations of you are very high.’ There’s no question, in my field, if we make a mistake, someone dies. So we take this very seriously. You must have the knowledge base to care for a critically ill patient. But I say, ‘Along with that high expectation that we have of you, we also expect that you have a high expectation of us. We are here to mentor you through this experience, so don’t you ever feel like you’re alone during this semester. We are here to guide you, to help you with whatever you need, whether it is something personal or academic, it doesn’t matter. We are here to help you, and we expect you to have high expectations of us.” Then we have to go forward and do as we’ve said, and if they come to us with a concern, we know it is our responsibility to address that until that student is satisfied. It’s okay to have a very rigorous class and have high expectations, but it’s not okay if you don’t expect yourself to perform at an equally high level for those students.",

Too often we think that we have to hold their hand for them to have a good experience, but they love to be challenged and to have somebody expect a lot out of them. As faculty, we also need to have high expectations of ourselves. We need to be strong spiritually, but we must also be experts in our fields. We need to have credibility in what we’re teaching, and then bring the spiritual piece together with it. That’s what creates excellence in the classroom. It would be pretty tough for me to be a very poor clinician but expect high things out of the students. It doesn’t matter how much spirituality I have if I don’t know what I’m talking about, I’m not going to hold any weight. We have to have a high standards for ourselves and then high standards for our students, and it’ll come together.",
